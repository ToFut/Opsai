  "pullRequestUrl": "https://github.com/user/my-app/pull/123",
  "commitMessage": "AI Improvements: 1 files updated"
}
```

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file with the following variables:

```env
# OpenAI API Key for AI-powered improvements
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here

# GitHub Token for creating pull requests (optional)
GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token_here

# Database URL (if using database)
DATABASE_URL=your_database_url_here

# Next.js configuration
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your_nextauth_secret_here
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:7250
```

## Usage

1. **Start the Development Server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   The app will run on port 7250.

2. **Access the Dashboard**:
   Navigate to `http://localhost:7250/dashboard`

3. **Select an App**:
   Choose an app from the right panel to start improving

4. **Chat with AI**:
   - Use the quick improvement categories for common requests
   - Type custom requests in the chat input
   - Click on AI suggestions to continue the conversation

5. **Review Code Changes**:
   - Switch to the "Code Changes" tab to see generated code
   - Review the changes before applying

6. **Apply Changes**:
   - Click "Apply Changes" to push to your repository
   - A new branch and pull request will be created automatically

## Technical Implementation

### Components
- `AppImprovementDashboard`: Main dashboard component with split layout
- Chat interface with real-time messaging
- Code preview with syntax highlighting
- Git integration for repository management

### State Management
- React hooks for local state management
- Real-time chat message updates
- Code change tracking and application

### API Integration
- OpenAI GPT-4 for intelligent responses
- GitHub API for repository operations
- File system operations for code generation

## Security Considerations

- All API keys are stored securely in environment variables
- Git operations use temporary directories that are cleaned up
- Input validation and sanitization on all user inputs
- Rate limiting on API endpoints (recommended)

## Future Enhancements

- **Real-time Collaboration**: Multiple users can collaborate on improvements
- **Code Review Integration**: Automated code review and testing
- **Deployment Integration**: Direct deployment after approval
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Track improvement metrics and success rates
- **Template Library**: Pre-built improvement templates for common scenarios
